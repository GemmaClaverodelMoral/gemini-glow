# Gemini Glow ‚ú®

A high-contrast theme for Visual Studio Code, meticulously designed to replicate the vibrant and clear color palette of code generated by Gemini, specifically for Python code.

-----

## What is Gemini Glow?

**Gemini Glow** was born from a simple goal: to achieve near-perfect visual parity between your local editor's code and the snippets generated by Gemini. If you, like me, enjoy the clarity and aesthetics of its syntax highlighting, this theme is for you.

Each color has been carefully selected to maximize legibility and reduce eye strain, using vibrant colors for key syntax (functions in yellow, keywords in purple, types in green) and more subtle tones for the rest of the code, all on a comfortable dark background.

## Your Python Code, Gemini Style

## ‚úçÔ∏è Recommended Settings (Important!)

For a 100% faithful experience to the Gemini style, not only do the colors matter, but also the font and how certain characters are rendered.

**1. Font:** I recommend using **Source Code Pro**, an open-source font from Google that is clean and very similar to the one used by Gemini.
**2. Font Ligatures:** To get the effect of separated underscores (`__init__`) instead of a continuous line, it is crucial to disable ligatures and use a font that allows it.

Copy and add the following configuration to your `settings.json` file (`Ctrl+Shift+P` > `Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)`):

```json
    "editor.fontFamily": "Inconsolata, Consolas, 'Courier New', monospace",
    "editor.fontLigatures": false
```
